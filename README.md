## Summary
This research project focuses on utilizing continual learning strategies to train image classification models on 2D periodic patterns belonging to different wallpaper groups. The goal is to surpass the performance of traditional deep learning approaches by addressing biases and irrelevant local information within the images. The project emphasizes the significance of learning fundamental symmetries, namely translation, rotation, reflection, and glide-reflection, which is second-order knowledge. The objective is to enable the model to comprehend and leverage the concept of symmetry, fostering a deeper understanding beyond edges and curvature alone. The project aims to contribute to the advancement of image classification by enhancing the model's ability to recognize and utilize symmetries in periodic patterns. This project is inspired by EscherNet101 (Funk, C. and Liu, Y. [2023](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.04208)).
