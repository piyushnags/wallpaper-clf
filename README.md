# A Novel Approach to Wallpaper Group Classification using Continual Learning
---

This project is still in progress!
---
## Summary
Classifying 2D wallpaper groups requires a model to learn second-order invariants from images. In this project, we explore if CL can aid in learning the invariants better than traditional Deep Learning approaches. This project is inspired by EscherNet101 [@https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.04208].
